# Space-time(r)

It's a fairly simple, standalone, pomodoro timer, combined with some of my favorite music to focus to. Yes, I can accomplish the same thing with my phone clock and spotify, but for every timer alarm that goes off, or song that I want to skip, that's a brand new opportunity for me to sidetrack myself. 

Combining the two things into one tool takes all of that out of my hands and lets me get to what's importnant.

## Functionality

There are two main functionalities for this project:

1. Timer with work duration, short break, and a long break.
2. Music functionality pulling from youtube. 

I had considered adding a task keeping feature, but as I was coding, I realized that the core of the site was; "How do I spend the least amount of time with my mouse in my hand". It's easier for me to jot down a task on a piece of scrap paper than it is to flip through a UI and add it to a list.

This is a site meant to address my base needs and nothing more. (albiet with a little visual flair I'll get into below.)

## Asthetics
I miss old school game UI. There's something very simple and clean about the menu's in old video games. Sections were clearly marked off, sliders were obvious, and buttons felt as clicky as digital buttons could be. 

I started off wanting to paint a picture of sitting at the controls of a spaceship. Then I began to replay Tales of Symphonia and was reminded of playing Chrono Trigger, and I began to work on UI elements in Aseprite. 

It didn't take long before I scrapped the idea of creating the assets depicting a ship's console and decided that a game menu had all the clarity and simplicity I needed. I kept the idea of planets that moved in time with the timer's countdown. Like sand in an hourglass, it's nice to have a visual representation of the passage of time, and besides, I'd already created the assets for the planets. 

 I know that it doesn't necessarily fit with the 2025 web design best practices. It's minimal and dark, there's not any customization or AI, but it's a website. It does a task, and it's got a visual language, and it doesn't have to do more than that. It's designed to keep time while you work,and also let you listen to the castlevania soundtrack, and if that's what you need to focus, well, here it is.
